# Welcome to Workshop on the Norwegian Web Archive

We are happy to have you onboard this workshop, exploring how data from the Norwegian Web Archive (NWA) can be utilised by researchers in the Humanities!

These pages contains documentation with how-to-guides and explanation of different tools and services currently in development.






The pages are built with [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/), a responsive [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)-theme for documentation with built-in search.
