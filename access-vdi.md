# Access the Services

The service are currently offered through a virtual environment (a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, also known as VDI). The machine you will be interacting with are in the National Library's infrastructure, while the screen of this machines are exposed to your computer.

We recommend that you install the [VMWare Horizon Client](https://www.vmware.com/go/viewclients) an run it as an application on your computer, but you can also use the service in your browser.

## 1. Login using VMWARE Horizon Client

1. Open VMWARE Horizon Client
2. Click the `+` icon to setup a new server
3. Enter the name of Connection Server (provided by the instructor). Press Connect
4. In the window that appears, enter username and password (provided by the instructor).

The virtual environment will now launch. This may take some time.

When you see the MS Windows desktop, you will be ready to use our services.

## 2. Login using web browser

1. In you browser, navigate to (url provided by the instructor).
2. Click "VMware Horizon HTML Access"
3. Enter username and password (provided by the instructor). Click "Login".
4. Double-click the computer icon.

The virtual environment will now launch. This may take some time.

NOTICE: If you use the browser mode, the screen of your virtual machine will be displayed in one of your browser tabs. If you are used to shortcuts for switching between applications or tabs, you may experience some confusions. E.g. `Ctrl+W`` will close your browser tab, and effectively shut down your virtual environment, forcing you to login again.
